CCTag library
===================


Detection of CCTag markers made up of concentric circles. Implementations in both CPU and GPU.

See paper: "Detection and Accurate Localization of Circular Fiducials under Highly Challenging Conditions." Lilian Calvet, Pierre Gurdjos, Carsten Griwodz and Simone Gasparini. CVPR 2016.

Markers to print are located [here](markersToPrint). 

**WARNING**
Please respect the provided margins. The reported detection rate and localization accuracy are valid with completly planar support: be careful not to use bent support (e.g. corrugated sheet of paper).

The four rings CCTags will be available soon.
